# TripleTen_IntegratedProject1

This project involves analyzing data for the online video game retailer Ice, which sells games globally. The available data includes user and expert reviews, game genres, platform information (e.g., Xbox or PlayStation), and historical sales figures from open sources.

The objective is to identify patterns that help determine a game's commercial success. These insights will support strategic decisions such as identifying potential top-selling games and planning effective advertising campaigns.

The dataset contains information up to the end of 2016. The analysis is conducted with the assumption that it is December 2016, and the goal is to use the findings to inform marketing efforts for the year 2017.
